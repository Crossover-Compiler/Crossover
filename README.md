# crossover
An experimental BabyCobol Compiler with C interoperability


# Installation
There are two prerequisite dependencies to be installed before you can build this project:
1. ```spdlog```
2. ```llvm```

Aditionally, make sure you have a Java runtime environment (```JRE```) installed.

We provide a short overview for installation of these dependencies on Ubuntu:
```
apt install libspdlog-dev
```
```
bash -c "$(wget -O - https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh)"
```

```
apt install clang
```
You may need root permission for these commands.


# Building
To build the crossover compiler, you can simply run cmake:
```
cmake .
```

# The BabyCobol standard library

The BabyCobol standard library (bstd) is used both during compilation and runtime and it is required to be present in the same folder as the Crossover executable. To compile the bstd library simply run ```compile_bstd.sh``` and move the .a file to your output folder.
 
# Using the compiler

```
USAGE: crossover <src...> <options>

Where <src...> are the space-separated (relative) paths to the BabyCobol source files. Does not support directories.

OPTIONS:

--help, -?, -ðŸ¤”: Display a help message and exit.

--verbose, -v: Print more messages to STD out.

-emit-llvm <filename>: Writes the generated LLVM IR to the specified file.

--debug, -d: Include debug symbols in the executable artefact.

--link <filename...>, -l <filename...>: Specifies the object files to include in linking.

--generate-structs, -g: If set, crossover will generate C headers for the data divisions in the BabyCobol source files.

--no-entry : specifies that the entry point of the executable artefact is in the specified object files (see --link).
```

# Programming guide

## Naming

BabyCobol paragraph names are internally case-insensitive. Across the FFI, paragraph names can be accessed in lower case only. Make sure to keep this in mind. Example:
```
BabyCobol
-------------------
PROCEDURE DIVISION.
FOO.
    CALL Foo.       <-- this is fine


C
-------------------
void bar() {
    FOO();          <-- this does not work
    foo();          <-- this works
}
```

## Additional notes
Paragraphs are not hoisted. This means that a paragraph needs to be defined before it can be called.
